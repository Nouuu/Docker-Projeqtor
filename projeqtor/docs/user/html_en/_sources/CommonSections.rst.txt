.. _recurrent-mode-assign:

Recurrent mode assignment
=========================

The recurring planning mode is the only mode that, by default, covers the entire duration of the project.

If the project is lengthened, then the task in recurring mode will lengthen accordingly.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/GANTT_BOX_RecurrentAssignment.png
   :alt: Recurring assignment
   
   Recurring assignment


During the assignment, you distribute the workload of your resource on a weekly basis.

You can enter a different value for each day of the week.

The :kbd:`copy` is an accelerator to copy the entered value on Monday every other day.

The total load will be calculated after validation according to the duration of your project and the assigned times.

.. warning:: 

   * It is a priority planning method.
   * Using this mode can add a significant workload!.














.. _plannedintervention-assign:

Planned Interventions assignment
================================

The assigned workload is no longer determined but will be entered on a calendar which can be clicked, per half-day.

See: :ref:`Planned interventions assignment<plannedintervention-assign>`

 .. compound:: Display Manual planning calendar  

   * Click on |Add| to add a new assignment. 
   
   * To see the workload distribution table, select the resource and confirm. Then click on the edit button.

      * If the assignment already exists, click directly on the |Edit|.

      * The calendar will then be displayed in the assignment window..
   
   * The display starts in the current month and spans the next six months.
   
   * Each box is divided into two half days. The assigned work is then automatically the sum of the selected half-days.

.. _treatment-section: 

Treatment section
-----------------

This section contains information on the treatment of articles, ie on the life and progress of the element.

It usually contains status information, macro reports, situations or those responsible for the work of this element.   
   

Depending on the item, this section may display different fields.

All the lists in this section are customizable.  


 .. compound:: Macro status
 
    The macros states work thanks to levers.
    
    Several states are populated directly based on the information you record.
   
   
    .. compound:: in progress
    
      The field is filled in when you fill in the first charge on your timesheet.

      Please note, the date recorded in the in progress field is the date on which the charge is entered and not the day on which it is entered.
    
    .. compound:: Done
    
      The field is filled in when you fill in the last charge on your timesheet.

      The remaining time MUST therefore be at 0 for this field to be completed.
    
    .. compound:: Closed
    
      The field is filled in when you close an element
    
    .. compound:: Cancelled

      The field is filled in when you cancel the element via the status of your workflow

Description of the different sections is grouped by the planning elements that have common fields and behavior.

Progress data are displayed in the same format, **but according to the planning element, fields can have another meaning or behavior.**

Below is the definition of the different columns that make up the Progress section.



.. _progress-section-date-duration:

Dates and duration
==================

The dates and durations section allow you to record and display different time information on your element.


.. rubric:: Validated

Validated dates are used for:

* Define the input parameters according to the selected planning mode - See: :ref:`Planning mode<planning-mode-gantt>`

* Define the initial due dates as a reference in order to check any drifts in your project

* Set a deadline by which the work must be completed.



.. rubric:: Planned

Planned dates can be defined with:

 .. compound:: **Requested or validated dates**

    The planned dates can be initialized with validated dates or requested dates (whether validated dates are not specified).

 .. compound:: **Planning calculation**

    The planned dates can be determined during the planning calculation.
    
    The planning calculation is done according to tasks assigned to resources and their predecessors.

    .. note:: **Planning mode "Fixed duration"**

      The planned dates of tasks will be calculated depending on their predecessors and their specified duration.

    .. warning:: **Planned dates of parent element**
      
      At parent element level, dates are adjusted with the first planned start date and the last planned end date from all sub-elements.

      The planned start date is adjusted to the real start date when work began.




.. rubric:: Real

These are the dates of work actually carried out. The work actually charged

The real start date is set when work began (handled).

The real end date is set when no more remaining work (done).

.. note:: Real dates of parent element 

   The real start date will be propagated to parent elements up to project.
   
   The real end date for parent element will be initialized, when all sub-element have been completed.
   
   

.. rubric:: Requested

Allows you to define forecast dates. These are generally the dates agreed with your client or the beneficiary of your activity..



.. rubric:: Duration

The durations correspond to the number of days between the start and end dates.

They are calculated automatically.

But you can also enter a start date and a number of days, the end date will be automatically calculated.


.. rubric:: Delay display

If the dates entered in the validated dates are lower than the dates calculated by the software - the planned dates, then the planned end date box is red as well as the bar of the Gantt chart corresponding to the element.

This then reflects a possible delay.

.. rubric:: Assigned

Sum of planned work assigned to resources and estimated cost.

.. rubric:: Real

Sum of work done by resources and cost incurred.

.. rubric:: Reassessed

Sum of resource total work that will be needed from start to end and the ensuing costs.

   .. code::
    
      [Reassessed] = [Real] + [Left]

.. topic:: Work on tickets

.. warning:: To display the technical progression section, which corresponds to an advancement in Unit of Work, you must position the option in the global parameters.
   
   See: :ref:`Global Parameters<gp_planning-section>`

The section technical progress is displayed on **Project** and **Activity** screen.

You determine the number of units of work to be performed on the activity.

The progress and the rest will be consolidated towards the father project and / or the mother activity. 


.. rubric:: Number of units

As for the dates and durations, you can enter several values for the realization of your units of works.

 .. compound:: To delivred

  Number of units to be delivered.
   
 .. compound:: To realise

  Number of units to be produced.

   .. compound:: Manual
   
     You define yourself the progress of the realization of your units of works.    

 .. compound:: Weight
 
  The weight defines a certain importance on the realization of these units.

  It determines how the calculation of the progress of the work units will be calculated and consolidated.
      
   .. compound:: Manual
   
     You enter a value manually according to the unit of work to be done.
     
   .. compound:: Unity of work

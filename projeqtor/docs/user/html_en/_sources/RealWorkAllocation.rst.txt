.. _data-entryvalidation-timesheet:

.. rubric:: |threeBLC| Data entry validation


:kbd:`Enter real as planned` 

* Planned work on an activity for a resource is carried forward for each day.

* If there is no figure displayed then it means that the resource is not supposed to be informed of the actual work on this activity during this period.

* Even if planned work is scheduled for a resource, there is nothing forcing it to complete its work as expected.

* The option **Show planned work** must be activated.



:kbd:`Submit work` 

ProjeQtOr offers a system of validation of charges which makes it possible to follow the information of the real work of resources by a hierarchical manager.

The validation system is optional and can therefore be hidden.

After sending the actual work, you can no longer change the actual working time for the week.

You must cancel the validation request to make a change.

 
:kbd:`Validate work`

* Project managers can validate the work or any other personalized profile authorized to do so.

* Only people with the necessary permissions can see this button

* When the work is validated, then the resource can no longer modify its work on this week. Likewise, the cancellation of validation will no longer be available.





.. _taskzone-imputation:

Click on the activity name to access the activity details screen.

Tasks assigned with actual work are always displayed, even when closed.

The function of the resource on this task is displayed at the end of the line.

.. Note:: 

   * A resource can have multiple :ref:`functions<resource-function-cost>`.

   * It is possible to :ref:`assign<assignment-section>` the same resource several times but with different functions to monitor project costs.


* The icon |AddComment| allows you to add a comment.
* The icon |Comment| indicates that there is a comment on the assigned task. 
* Simply move the mouse over the icon to see the latest comment.
* Click to view all comments

.. _entryfield-timesheet:

.. rubric:: |fiveBLC| Entry field


In order to see and know the assignments on a task, several columns indicate the periods assigned to a resource


 .. compound:: Assigned

   It is the work assigned to the resource that is calculated by the software.
   
 .. compound:: Real work

   This is the work actually performed and reported by the resource.
   
 .. compound:: Left work
   
   This is the work that the resource still has to provide for this task
   
   Left work is automatically decreased on input of real work.
   
   Resources can adjust this value to estimate the work needed to complete the task.
   
 .. compound:: Reassessed
   
   This is the work required to complete the task. It's the actual work + the rest to do. See: "progress-section-date-duration"
   
   * You cannot edit Assigned Work, Actual Work, and Reassessed directly in columns.
      
   * This information is calculated directly by the software based on what you have entered




.. _real-work-entry:

 .. compound:: Real work entry

   * Area to enter real work. It possible put real work in off days.
   * Columns of days off is displayed in grey.
   * Days off is determine in resource :ref:`calendar definition<calendars>`.


 .. compound:: Total of days
   
   On the last row is the sum for all days of the week. 
      
   It is a synthesis displayed for each project and globally for the whole week.
   
   The resource capacity is defined by the number of hours per day and the resource capacity (fte).
   
         
   .. figure:: /images/GUI/REALWORK_ZONE_TimesheetTotalDay.png
      :alt: Total of the day
         
      Total of the day Zone  
   

   * The total of the day is **green** whether entries respects the resource capacity of days.
   * The total of the day is **red** whether entries is more than the resource capacity of days.
   * The total of the day is **no colored** whether entries is less than the resource capacity of days.



.. seealso:: Timesheet parameters

   * :ref:`Unit for work<unitForWork-section>`
   
     Allows to set the unit time for real work and workload and the number of days worked per week. The number of hours per day is defined here.
           
   * :ref:`Timesheet<realWorkAllocation-section>` 
   
     You can set many levers, alerts or display options
      
   * :ref:`Generation of alerts if real work is not entered<gp-genereation-alert-realwork>`
   
     You can trigger alerts on the entry of actual work for different collaborators.
     These messages can be sent at a frequency defined by email or displayed as an alert directly in the application.
    
   * :ref:`Automatic feeding of the real<automatic-planning-calcul>`

The status of tasks
===================

The task status can be changed automatically according to data entries on real work and left work.

* Set to first **in progress** status: if the parameter value is set to "Yes", when real work is entered on a task, its status will be changed automatically to the first status "handled".

* Set to first **done** status: if the parameter value is set to "Yes", when left work is set to zero on a task, its status will be changed automatically to the first status "done".

 .. compound:: Change status validation

   An icon will be displayed on the task if a status change is applicable.

   * |statusStart| Due to real work is entered, the task status will be changed to the first 'handled' status.
   * |statusStartKO| The real work is entered, but the task status will not change because at issue is occurring. 
   * |statusFinish| Due to no more left work, the task status will be changed to the first ‘done’ status.
   * |statusFinishKO| No more left work, but the task status will not change because at issue is occurring. 

   .. warning:: Common issue

    * If a :term:`responsible` or a :term:`result` are set as mandatory in element type definition for the task. It's impossible to set those values by real work allocation screen.
    * The change status must be done in treatment section on the task definition screen.

         * **Green:** The completed job is the same as the expected one.
   
         * **Red:** The filled workload is shorter or longer. It does not match the expected work.
   
         * **Orange:** the job is not the same as the expected job but the load is the same.

.. _monthly-consolidation:

Monthly consolidation
---------------------

Monthly consolidation allows you to view, control and validate resource allocations to a particular project for an entire month.
This screen will list all the projects on which the user has visibility.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/REALWORK_SCR_MonthlyConsolidation.png

   Monthly consolidation screen

**Filters will limit the list:**

• Project to restrict the listed projects to this project and its sub-projects
• Project Type to restrict the listed projects to projects of this type
• Organization to restrict the listed projects to the projects of this organization
• Month and year to restrict to this date

.. note:: By default, this will be the last month for which projects are still blocked, or failing this it will be the current month.

**This screen will display for each project not validated:**

• The currently known CA
• The currently known validated load
• The total actual load currently known to the project
• The actual load consumed on the project for the selected month
• The remainder to be done currently known
• The currently known reassessed load
• The currently known margin (load) = load validated - load reassessed


For validated projects, the data displayed is that stored during validation.


.. rubric:: Block a project over a month

The |unlocked| and |locked| buttons allow you to block or unblock charges beyond the month-end date. When the project is blocked for a given month, you cannot enter a charge for the following month, even if it has started. The block will be propagated recursively to sub-projects.


.. rubric:: Validate a project over a month

The |submitted| and |unsubmitted| buttons allow you to block or unblock charges beyond the month-end date. When the project is blocked for a given month, you cannot enter a charge for the following month, even if it has started. The block will be propagated recursively to sub-projects.


.. warning:: 
   
   Access to the blocking / unlocking and the validation button will be configured by a :ref:`specific right<monthly-consolidation-rights>`.











   


   





.. _absence:

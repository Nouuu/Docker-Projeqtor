A workflow defines the possibility to go from one status to another one, and who (depending on profile) can do this operation for each status.

Once defined, a workflow can be linked to any type of any item.

* The habilitation table helps defining who can move from one status to another one.
* Each line corresponds to the status from which you want to be able to move.
* Each column corresponds to the status to which you want to be able to go.
* It is not possible to go from one status to itself (these cells are blank).
* Just check the profile (or “all”) who is allowed to pass from one status to the other.

In the model, the user can use any property of the subject and display it in the mail using specific tags.

you just need to use the tag $ {projectName} for the name of the project to appear and $ {idproject} to display the identification number of this one.

   
.. tip::
   
   For properties referencing an external element, such as idXxxxx, use ${nameXxxxx}
   
     
Other tags are available as parameters for email titles

      If the maximum size allowed does not allow all files to be sent, then the software will stop until the maximum size is reached.
   
      If the last attached file saved in the software alone exceeds the maximum authorized size, then no file is sent.

   see: :ref:`manual_notification`.

Notification definition in control and automation menu allows you to create notifications about events

Notification System

.. figure:: /images/GUI/CONTROLAUTO_SCR_NotificationsSystem.png

   Notifications system screen

.. rubric:: Creation

**The definition of notification generation is based on the following:**

* The title that can contain the field values of the notifiable element or its sub-elements

* The element of the system that determines the notification, called "Notifiable Element" (notifiable)

* The type of notification (Alert, Warning, Information)
   
* The notification rule notifying the elements related to the generation of a notification

* The content may also contain the field values of the notifiable element or its sub-elements.

* The date (referred to as the reference date) at which the notification must be generated. This is one of the dates of the notifiable item that is not the creation date.

* The generated notification receivers. Fields of the notifiable element or its sub-elements that refer to users.
         
* The choice to send, or not, to all the sending of emails at the same time as the notifications.


.. rubric:: Section Description

This section briefly describes the type of notification

Its name, its type: alert, information or warning as well as the notifiable element.


.. rubric:: Section Notification title

This section allows you to give a title to your notification.

This title will be the object of the programmed mail if you tick the box **send an email** in the receivers section

You can add dynamic fields with **help to insert a dynamic field in the title**

The title of the notification can therefore contain fields of the "notifiable" object and its linked elements via an idXXX.

where XXX is the name of the linked item. 

Select an object and / or a field and click the Insert button so that the dynamic field with the correct syntax fits directly in the title, where the cursor is.

In this case, the syntax must be: `#{the name of the field}` ...

.. tip::

   #{billId} - Invoice not paid - Sent on #{sendDate}
   If the rule (see below) of the instruction on the invoice of 'billId' 2019-12-30-0001 whose sending date is 30-12-2019 
   then the title of the notification will be:
   
   **2019-12-30-0001 - Invoice not paid - Submitted on 12-30-2019**

.. rubric:: Section Rule to apply

.. figure:: /images/GUI/CONTROLAUTO_ZONE_NotificationsRules.png

   Notifications rules
   
This rule determines which instance of the item will generate a notification.

The syntax is the one we take for a WHERE clause in an SQL statement.

.. tip:: 

   Scheduling a notification for all invoices where the amount has been paid = total amount AND project name 'ACME'

   #{paymentAmount} < #{fullAmount}
   AND
   #{idProject.name} = 'ACME'
   AND
   isnull (#{paymentDate)

.. note::

   The rule to apply is not mandatory. If the rule is empty, then only the reference date is used to determine whether or not a notification is generated. 
  
   In addition to choosing a dynamic field, you can choose to use an operator or function with the following elements:


.. rubric:: Notification content

This section is mandatory

You can also add dynamic fields with **help to insert a dynamic field in content** in the same way as in the description section

      * Notify before: This is a number of days before the notification date for which the notification is to be generated
      
      * This field is mandatory       

--------------   
   
   Example "delivery expected date" is selected. 
   
   For all deliverables that do not follow the previous rule, a notification will be generated if the delivery date is not respected.
   
--------------
   
   .. compound:: **Every year**
   
   * If the year is checked, the generator is a notification every year to the month and the day of the reference date
   
   * If the year is checked, the month and day filled, then it is a birthday. The reference date will not be used.
   
   .. compound:: **Every month / Week / Open day**
   
   * Is selected, responsive notifications will be generate monthly / weekly or each open day 
   
   
.. rubric:: Receivers
   
These are the types of people who are notified.
   
The syntax is as follows: One of the words in the "Help Authorized Recipients" 

section separated by a ';
   
The following items allow you to choose the type of remitter.
   
If :kbd:`Sent e-mail` checked, an e-mail will be generated even if the notification for each type of person has been defined.

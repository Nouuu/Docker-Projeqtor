Planning management
*******************

ProjeQtOr provides all the elements needed to build a planning from workload, constraints between tasks and resources availability.

.. topic:: **Multiple Access** 

   Users can edit the same item (if they get the right to do it) at the same time, without disturbing each other, as long as they do not change the same fields.

.. index:: Planning management (Project)

.. rubric:: Project

The project is the main element of ProjeQtOr.

It is also the highest level of visibility and definition of access rights based on profiles.

You can define profiles, some have visibility on all projects, others only on the projects they are assigned to.

You can also define sub-projects of a project and sub-project of sub-projects without limit to this hierarchical organization.

This allows for example to define projects that are not real projects , but just a definition of the structure for your organization.

Projects and sub-projects appear on the :ref:`Gantt Planning view<Planning>`.

.. index:: Planning management (Activity)
 
.. rubric:: Activity
 
An activity is a task that must be planned, or includes other activities.

This is usually a task that has a certain duration and should be assigned to one or more resources.

Activities appear on the :ref:`Gantt Planning view<Planning>`.

.. index:: Planning management (Milestone)

.. rubric:: Milestones
 
A milestone is an event or a key date of the project.

Milestones are commonly used to track delivery dates or force a start date of activity.

They can also be used to highlight the transition from one phase to the next one.

Unlike activities , milestones have no duration and no work.

But on Projeqtor, you can specify deadlines (positive or negative) to apply to your milestones 

See: :ref:`Milestones on the Gantt chart view<milestones-gantt>`






.. index:: Planning management (Resource)

.. rubric:: Resources
 
Resources can be assigned to activities.

This means that some work is defined on this activity for the resource.

Only the resources allocated to the project of the activity can be assigned to the activity.

.. index:: Planning management (Real work allocation) 

.. rubric:: Real work allocation
 
Resources enter their time spent on the Real work allocation screen in their :ref:`timesheet<timesheet>`.

This allows for a real-time monitoring of work.

Moreover, updating the left work allows to recalculate the planning taking into account the actual progress on each task.

.. index:: Planning management (Planning)

.. rubric:: Planning
 
The planning is based on all the constraints defined:

   * left work on each activity
   
   * availability of resources
   
   * rate of resource allocation to projects 

   * assignment rate of resources to activities
   
   * planning mode for each activity (as soon as possible, fixed duration, ... )
   
   * dependencies between activities
   
   * priorities of activities and projects

The planning is displayed as a :ref:`Gantt chart<Planning>`.

.. index:: Planning management (Project portfolio)

.. rubric:: Project Portfolio
 
The planning can also be viewed as a :ref:`project portfolio<project-portfolio>`, which is a Gantt planning view restricted to one line per project, plus optionally selected milestones.

.. index:: Planning management (Global Planning)

.. rubric:: Global Planning
 
The :ref:`Global Planning<gantt-planning>` allows you to display many more elements on the gantt chart in addition to the usual projects, activities, and milestones.

In this diagram view, you can view decisions, test sessions, deliveries, risks, tickets or opportunities ... 

All of which can be linked to an activity or any other element of the diagram. 

.. index:: Planning management (Resource planning)

.. rubric:: Resource Planning
 
You can display the planning for each resource, but also by team, by pool or you can display all the resources whatever their assignments or assignments.

.. index:: Resource management

Resource management
*******************

ProjeQtOr manages the availability of resources that can be allocated to multiple projects. Tool calculates a reliable, optimized and realistic planning.

.. index:: Resource management (Resource)
.. rubric:: Resources

A resource can be a person working on the activities of one or more projects. Or material assigned to a particular task..

A resource can also be a group of persons (team) for which you do not want to manage individual detail.

You can manage this through the capacity of the resource, that can be greater than 1 (for a group of people) or less than 1 (for a person working part-time).

.. index:: Resource management (Allocation)
.. rubric:: Allocations
 
The first step is to allocate each resource to the projects on which it has to work, specifying the allocation rate (% of maximum weekly time spent on this project).

.. index:: Resource management (Assignment)
.. rubric:: Assignments
 
Then you can assign resources to project activities.

This means that some work is defined on this activity for the resource.

Only the resources allocated to the project of the activity can be assigned to the activity.

.. index:: Resource management (Calendar)
.. rubric:: Calendars
 
To manage working and non-working days, for resources with reduced working hours or with a different rhythm from the French calendar, 
for public holidays or holidays, you have configurable calendars.

You can create multiple calendars to manage different types of availability.

* you can create a '80% 'calendar with every Wednesday closing day, for example.

* you can manage separate vacations when working with international teams.

* Each resource is then assigned to a calendar.

* identify opportunities,
* monitor the actions of risks contingency and mitigation,
* identify risks that eventually do happen (so they become issues).

Issue is a risk that happens during the project.

If the risk management plan has been properly managed, the issue should be an identified and qualified risk.

Humans Resources

.. important:: **Documentation** 
   
   The human resources module was developed by an external contributor SALTO CONSULTING. The explanations below have been taken from the instructions, provided in French only, with the module.
   * `French documentation <https://www.projeqtor.org/files/ProjeQtOr%20-%20Documentation%20-%20Absences%20r%C3%A9glement%C3%A9es.pdf>`_ on the implementation of regulated absences is available on the `download page <https://www.projeqtor.org/fr/product-fr/downloads-fr/>`_

   The HR module was created in order to be easily adapted to French law, but it can be fully parameterized according to the rights of any country


This section allows to manage the society's Humans Resources. 

This system comes in addition to the standards of the management of absences.

Used to manage absences that must be validated, controlled and have values to be regulated according to French law.

For the module to be functional, you must define the employees, new status for resources or users. 

The absence manager in charge of leave, the types of leave you offer to your employees and the different types of employment contracts.


* Start to define the :ref:`employee-manager`, :ref:`leaves-types` and :ref:`employment-contract-type` 

* You can choose the leave entitlement standard for each type of contract

* The employee may reserve periods of leave of absence according to his rights.

* The system also includes a validation process of the requests during the leave period.


 .. compound:: Absence Administrator

   In order to be able to manage and configure the human resources module after its installation, you must access the :ref:`global parameters<leaves-system>`.
   
   A special additional HR section allows you to define the administrator of absences and regulated rights.
   


It is thus possible to manage the paid holidays, the RTT, the Stopped diseases by treating:

   * Quantities acquired over a period of time
   * The period of validity of a quantity of absence 
   * The possibility or not to take early holidays over the period being acquired
   * The number of days before and after which the absence request can be made
   * Specific acquisition rules
   * Validation or rejection of an application
   
.. note:: A project dedicated to these regulated absences is created and makes it possible to store the requested days of absence as planned time 
   and the days of absence validated as working time thus making it possible to integrate these absences in the planning.   

.. rubric:: Leaves States   

With the activation of the HR module, an absence workflow is added with 3 states, which are accessible and customizable in the :ref:`automation systems<workflow>`.

   .. compound:: Recorded

      Creation status. In this state all the data of the absence can be modified.
      
   .. compound:: Submitted

      This status means that the employee has sent his leave request to his hierarchy for validation.      
      
   .. compound:: Validated

      State that only the manager and the administrator of the module can be enabled.
      
      When the leave request is validated or refused, the status of the request cannot be changed
      
   .. compound:: Cancelled

      State that only the manager and the administrator of the module can be enabled.
            
      The number of days the absence represents are not taken.
      
      When the leave request is validated or refused, the status of the request cannot be changed


.. note:: 

   The calculation of the number of days represented by absence is done on the basis of working days.
   
   The working days are defined in :ref:`global_parameters` and :ref:`calendar<calendars>` associated with employee: holidays, non-working days.

The properties below is visible only when the :ref:`HR module<module-management>` is enabled


.. rubric:: Employee

An employee is a :ref:`resource` whose property **"is an employee"** is checked in the screen resources.

You find the same fields of description as the resources.

In this section, the employee can see the person who manage its leaves periods.



 .. compound:: Employment Contract
      
   This section is visible and linked to the :ref:`employment-contract-type` screen.
   
   To an employee are associated a :ref:`employment-contract` and :ref:`leaves-rights-earned`.
         
   The contract is associated with a :ref:`employment-contract-type`.
         
   This allow the employee to associate the rules of acquisition, the special rules of regulated absences and the acquired rights by type of absence and by acquisition period.


.. rubric:: Manager

A manager is a resource whose properties **"is an employee"** and **"is absence manager"** are checked

The regulation of absences is based on the rights to take absences acquired over a given period.

It is therefore based on values to be given to attributes of regulation according to the type of absence (ex: Paid leave, RTT, sick leave, legal leave, etc.), and the type of contract associated with the employee (Ex: Full time, Part time).


.. rubric:: General acquisition of rights

When you create a :ref:`employment-contract-type`, you have several contractual values to fill in.

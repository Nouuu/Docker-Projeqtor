Revenue Managment
-----------------
     
You can manage the turnover of the project at completion, and its consistency with the orders and invoices on the project.


A "Revenue management" section is visible on the projects screen in the Progress section after activation of the "Revenue management" module under the financial section.

   
**The following information is then accessible:**

* The turnover at completion corresponds to the total amount that will be invoiced for this project.

* Display of the sum of the project's customer orders

* Display of the sum of customer invoices for the project

* Method of valuation of turnover


 .. compound:: Method of valuation of turnover fixed
    
   The turnover is fixed and is entered manually
   


 .. compound:: Method of valuation of turnover variable
 
   Variable over time depending on the activities 

   The turnover will then be calculated from the turnover of all the activities (not canceled) of the project and possibly of the sub-projects. In this case the activities will also have a turnover field to feed.

   Projects with sub-projects will systematically have a “Variable” valuation mode, this mode will automatically consolidate the turnover of the sub-projects on the parent project.
        

.. rubric:: Consistency with project orders and invoices

For projects with sub-projects, the sum of orders and invoices will consolidate the data of the sub-projects, that is to say, it will integrate the orders and invoices of the sub-projects in addition to the orders and invoices possibly on the project itself.

The sum of the orders is in red if it is lower than the turnover.
The sum of the invoices is in red if it is greater than the turnover.


.. rubric:: Raise alerts

You can create definable alerts for projects in the "unit indicators" section:

   * Revenue upper than command's sums
   * Revenue less than invoices sums

In order to integrate this evolution into the community version, without disturbing the users who do not need this functionality, we will condition the behavior:
   
In order to transcribe the current use of the validated cost, a :ref:`global parameter<gp-revenue-work-unit>` will determine whether the turnover is automatically reported as validated cost on activities and projects.



.. note:: 

   This functionality is only visible if the Revenue Management module is activated via the access rights menu in :ref:`Modules management<module-management>`.
   
   The Revenue Managment is a sub-module of the financial module. 
   
   This new module will activate / desactivate the management of OUs and everything related to the management of OUs (see below). 
   
   This module will be disabled by default.
    
    
    
.. index:: Work unit catalog

.. _work-unit-catalog:

Work units catalog
==================

The objective is to define catalogs of work units, made up of work units, themselves broken down into several complexities. 

This functionality will only be accessible if the :ref:`Revenue management<module-management>` module is activated.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/INCOMES_ZONE_WorkUnitCatalog.png

   Work units Catalog screen
   
The catalog has no inheritance. It is only linked to one and the same project.

If your catalog is attached to a parent project, the sub-projects of the latter will not have access to this catalog and vice versa.

You can select an OU on an activity, if the project has a “Variable” turnover valuation mode.

.. warning:: 

   If the number of complexity isn't filled then the default number set in the :ref:`global parameters<gp-revenue-work-unit>` is applied.
   
   
Then fill in the fields with the name of the complexities managed by this catalog.

Click on |Add| to open the pop-up windows and complete the complexity details.

You can fill in the following fields for each OU:

   * Reference
   * Description
   * Incomes
   * Deliverable 
   * validity date 

The description, incoming and deliverable fields are text editors in inline mode. Edit buttons appear when the cursor is in the field.

   Pop-up of the complexities details
   
   
For each complexity of the OU, we can define:

* Validated load of complexity - 0 is allowed
* Price (CA) of complexity
* Duration in working days - optional


It is not mandatory to fill in all the complexities for an OU. 

The description, incoming and deliverable fields are text editors in "inline" mode. The edit buttons appear when the cursor is in the field.


   
.. rubric:: Use of a catalog of work units

You can select an OU on an activity, only if the project has a Variable CA valuation mode.

We will inform the OU, its complexity and the number of units:

   * Entering the OU in the list of OUs in the catalog linked to the project. This will dynamically populate the list of OU complexities by displaying only those that have a charge and a price that is not zero but may be equal to zero.
   * Entering complexity
   * Entering the quantity number of work units
   
An activity will only be associated with a single OU / Complexity pair.

If OU is selected, complexity and quantity are mandatory, otherwise they are prohibited, i.e. not enterable.

The UO / Complexity / Quantity data will make it possible to value:
   * The validated load = load of the OU / Complexity x Quantity
   * The turnover of the activity = price of the OU / Complexity x Quantity
   * The validated duration = duration of the OU / Complexity x Quantity

Entering the validated duration will automatically calculate the validated end date if the validated start date is entered.

.. note::
   
   This will only determine the planned duration of the activity if it is in "fixed duration" planning mode. Otherwise, the schedule will determine the planned duration from the assigned load and the availability of assigned resources.

These 3 data (validated load, validated duration, CA) will then go into read-only since they are calculated.

If the OU's expiry date has passed, an alert will be displayed on the activity, without this blocking the recording of the activity.

If the global parameter "Report of turnover on the validated cost of activities" is activated, the turnover entered or entered through the OU is recopied in the validated cost of the activity.   



.. rubric:: modification of data

You can modify the catalog on the data of an OU, a Complexity or a Quantity however it is not possible to modify a unit of work from the catalog, if it is already used on an activity. 


* Re-calculation of validated data: validated load, validated duration and turnover
* If resources are assigned, application of the variation in the assigned load, in proportion to the load assigned to each resource and updating of the “still to do” accordingly (without ever being able to become negative).

.. tip:: 

   **For example:**
   
   In the case of an OU whose complexity generates 5 days of load with a quantity of 1, if A is assigned for 2 days and B assigned for 3 days, if we double the quantity (and therefore the validated load) A is then assigned 4 days and B is assigned 6 days.


.. rubric:: Deletion of data

You can delete the catalog on the data of an OU, a Complexity or a Quantity however it is not possible to delete a unit of work from the catalog, if it is already used on an activity. 

* The validated load data, validated duration and CA become manually modifiable again
* The calculated data is kept

The project turnover will be updated from the sum of the turnover of the project activities, whether this data is entered from an OU or entered manually.

The turnover of the activities and the UO, Complexity and Quantity data will only be accessible for "basic" activities (which do not have sub-activities). For "parent" activities, the turnover will be consolidated from the turnover of the sub-activities.

   Action
   
     Stocks are used in anticipation of risk. They serve to reduce the risks.

     The analysis of these risks consists in defining actions. There are two types of actions:

       * Preventive action aimed at removing the risk or
       * Corrective action that has been earned on the occurrence of a risk

   Activity
   
      An Activity can be likened to the key stages of the project: it is the skeleton of your project that organizes the main phases of a project
         
         * They have a start and end date
         * They designed for the planning phases of a project 
         * They serve to organize the milestones and tasks of a project
         * They can allocated to a or many resources
         * They can be prioritized and have sub-activities

   Gantt chart
   
      Description  The Gantt chart is a tool used in scheduling and project management 
      and allowing to visualize in time the various tasks composing a project. 
      
      It is a representation of a connected graph, evaluated and oriented, 
      which makes it possible to graphically represent the progress of the project 
   
   Handled

    * Flag to indicate that item has been taken into account.
    * Date of handling is saved.
    * This generally means that responsible has been named.

   Id

    * Every item has a unique Id, automatically generated on creation.
    * Id is chronologically allocated, for all kind of items (Activity, Ticket).
    * Id is shared for all projects and all types (i.e. incident) of the same kind items (i.e. Ticket).

   Incident
   
      Any event that is not part of the standard operation of a service and that causes, 
      or may cause, an interruption or decrease in the quality of that service   

   Issuer

      .. seealso:: **Creation information**

         The issuer name and creation date of an item are displayed in the :ref:`Creation information zone<detail-window>`.
   
   Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
   
      Indispensable to the project manager, an indicator makes it possible to evaluate a situation and to make an adapted decision. 
      Key performance indicators measure the performance of your projects. 
      You choose them together with your team. They must be simple, reliable, easily understandable by all and relevant
   
      If the indicator is green, all is well, you will need to continue the actions in progress to maintain this good result.  
      If the indicator is red, then you must take the necessary corrective action.   
      If the indicator is orange, it should be monitored.   
            
         * Each indicator is associated with a specific goal.  
         * An indicator necessarily implies a decision.
         * An indicator is never silent.  
         * A relevant indicator must be simple
         
   Objective
   
      An objective is a goal to achieve by carrying out different tasks. For example, building a new plant in order to produce more and meet the growing demand. It is essential to precisely define the goal (s) to reach so that you and your team know where you are going. 
      A good goal must be :term:`SMART`.   
 
   Origin

    * Determines the element of origin.
    * The origin is used to keep track of events (ex.: order from quote, action from meeting).
    * More detail, see : :ref:`Origin field<origin-field>`.

   Owner builder 
   
      The client is the person on whose behalf the work is carried out. It is the sponsor and the one who bears the financial cost. 
      The client is a natural or legal person, public law or private law

   PERT chart (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)
   
      provides a practical method and means to describe, represent, analyze and logically follow the tasks and the network of tasks to be carried out as part of an action to be undertaken or to be followed.
      The PERT diagram represents the work schedule by a dependency graph. 
      His network formalism focuses on the interconnection of the tasks to be performed and the calculation of critical paths. 
      
      An important difference with the Gantt chart is the conventional time scale of the PERT chart which represents a sequence of tasks 
      and not durations or a calendar

   Risks
   
      The risk is a hazard, an undesirable event whose appearance is not certain, 
      resulting in the possibility that the project does not achieve the objectives of: 
      
         * Completion date
         * Costs
         * Specifications (techniques, quality, performance , reliability ...) 
         * Others: Image of the company, environment, legal, social ...

      The risk can put in danger the project, deviations from forecasts the making it unacceptable or totally unacceptable.
      We distinguished the risks exogenous (external at now ; suppliers, evolution regulation, political, social, meteorology...)
   
   Quality 
   
      The Quality approach consists in finding the match between the answer to the needs of the project, 
      the correct expression of these needs by adequate specifications which go through a careful listening of the customer, 
      and a realization answering the expression of the needs.

   User

       Setting appropriate targets will help accelerate project completion and improve its chances of success.
   
   Status

    * The status determines the life cycle of items.
    * It defines the progress of the treatment of the item.
    * Item is linked to a element type, element type is linked to a workflow.
    * A workflow defines the possibility to go from one status to another one, more detail, see: :ref:`workflow`.

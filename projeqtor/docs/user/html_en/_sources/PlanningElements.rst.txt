.. rubric:: Real work allocation

* For a resource, assigned activities are tasks in which he can entry the :ref:`Real work<real-work-allocation>` 

.. rubric:: Activities regroupment

* Activities can have parents to regroup activities. 
* So a :term:`WBS` (work breakdown structure number) is calculated for the activities.

* Parent activity must belong to the same project.

.. rubric:: Fix planning 

* When box “fix planning” is checked, the activity scheduling won’t be remade.
* This will avoid change on planned values.
* The planning will always be the same whatever you do on other projects.

A milestone is a flag in the planning, to point out key dates.

Milestones are commonly used to check delivery dates.

They can also be used to highlight the transition from one phase to the next.

ProjeQtOr offers two types of milestone:

 .. compound:: **Floating milestone**

    * This milestone will automatically move to take into account dependencies.

 .. compound:: **Fixed milestone**

    * This milestone is fixed in the planning, not taking into account predecessor dependencies.
    * This kind of milestone is interesting, for instance to set-up start date for some tasks.
    * Fixed date is set by validated date.

.. rubric:: Monitoring indicator

* The indicators can be defined in the :ref:`List of Values<list-of-values>`.

* See: :ref:`health-status` and :ref:`overall-progress`

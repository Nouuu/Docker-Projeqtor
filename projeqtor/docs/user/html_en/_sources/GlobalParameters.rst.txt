.. _SSO_Saml2:

.. rubric:: Single Sign On SAML2

Single sign-on is a method that allows a user to access multiple computer applications (or secure websites) by performing a single authentication.

.. figure:: /images/GUI/GLOBALPARAM_ZONE_ConnexionSSO.png
   :alt: Connexion screen with the protocol SSO
   
   With the single sign on you do not go through the login screen of projeqtor but by a screen dedicated to single sign-on

When connected to the SSO service, the service tells each application that the user is logged on. 

This avoids having to connect to applications one by one.

In concrete terms, the site or service to which the user is trying to connect makes a request to the server or the identity provider's site. This one asks if the user is connected. If so, he transmits the information.

Depending on the protocol used, the two sites exchange keys, signatures and / or other information to verify the identity of the user.

   Disconnection screen
   
When you want to disconnect from ProjeQtOr with the SSO method, the logout screen gives you several options.

* Internal reconnection: I reconnect to ProjeQtOr locally. I leave my SSO session. I should identify myself again
* SSO disconnect. I leave my SSO session. I should identify myself again    

   .. compound:: Parameters
   
      This is an SSO connection via the SAML2 protocol

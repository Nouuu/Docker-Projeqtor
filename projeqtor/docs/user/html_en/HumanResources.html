<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>The human resources module was developed by an external contributor SALTO CONSULTING. The explanations below have been taken from the instructions, provided in French only, with the module.
* <a class="reference external" href="https://www.projeqtor.org/files/ProjeQtOr%20-%20Documentation%20-%20Absences%20r%C3%A9glement%C3%A9es.pdf">French documentation</a> on the implementation of regulated absences is available on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.projeqtor.org/fr/product-fr/downloads-fr/">download page</a></p>
<p class="last">The HR module was created in order to be easily adapted to French law, but it can be fully parameterized according to the rights of any country</p>
</div>
<p>This section allows to manage the society’s Humans Resources.</p>
<p>This system comes in addition to the standards of the management of absences.</p>
<p>Used to manage absences that must be validated, controlled and have values to be regulated according to French law.</p>
<p>For the module to be functional, you must define the employees, new status for resources or users.</p>
<p>The absence manager in charge of leave, the types of leave you offer to your employees and the different types of employment contracts.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Start to define the <a class="reference internal" href="#employee-manager"><span class="std std-ref">Employees and Manager</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#leaves-types"><span class="std std-ref">Leaves types</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#employment-contract-type"><span class="std std-ref">Employment contract type</span></a></li>
<li>You can choose the leave entitlement standard for each type of contract</li>
<li>The employee may reserve periods of leave of absence according to his rights.</li>
<li>The system also includes a validation process of the requests during the leave period.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="compound">
<p class="compound-first">Absence Administrator</p>

<p class="compound-last">A special additional HR section allows you to define the administrator of absences and regulated rights.</p>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>It is thus possible to manage the paid holidays, the RTT, the Stopped diseases by treating:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Quantities acquired over a period of time</li>
<li>The period of validity of a quantity of absence</li>
<li>The possibility or not to take early holidays over the period being acquired</li>
<li>The number of days before and after which the absence request can be made</li>
<li>Specific acquisition rules</li>
<li>Validation or rejection of an application</li>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">A project dedicated to these regulated absences is created and makes it possible to store the requested days of absence as planned time
and the days of absence validated as working time thus making it possible to integrate these absences in the planning.</p>

<p>With the activation of the HR module, an absence workflow is added with 3 states, which are accessible and customizable in the <a class="reference internal" href="ControlAutomation.html#workflow"><span class="std std-ref">automation systems</span></a>.</p>
